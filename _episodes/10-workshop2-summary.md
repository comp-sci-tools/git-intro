## What we have discussed so far:

* Git workflow with branches - useful tips:

    * use branches to experiment and to work on things in parallel;
    * branch often
    * keep the `master` branch as clean as possible
    * make sure you are on a right branch (`git branch`, `git status`)


* It is good to have a remote host for your repository:
    * e.g. use web services like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

* It is a good practice (in most cases) to commit your work - if you made a mistake, everything can be reverted

	* use `git revert <commit-SHA>`
