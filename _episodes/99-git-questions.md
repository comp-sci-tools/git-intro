* how to track changes in Word (`*doc`) or Office (`*odt`) documents?

	* [convert to markdown, then track changes in markdown files](https://github.com/vigente/gerardus/wiki/Integrate-git-diffs-with-word-docx-files)
	* [related post (also suggesting to convert to md)](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/)
	* [more comments from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22439517/view-docx-file-on-github-and-use-git-diff-on-docx-file-format/32712206)
 

* using Git on LaTeX files:
	* "git is good at merges, given reasonable input" ([reference](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/441944/how-well-does-git-handle-merges))

    * some suggestions:
		* "write each sentence on a separate line" ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6188780/git-latex-workflow))


    * tools to consider (not tested):
		* [git-latexdiff](https://github.com/redreamality/git-latexdiff)
