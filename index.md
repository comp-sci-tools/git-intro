# Introduction to version control with Git

This is the introductory lesson to version control
using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), 
modified after the [CodeRefinery tutorial](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).


## Goals

The goals of the module as a whole are that the user will feel comfortable
about staging changes, committing them, merging, and branching.

We work on the guacamole
example, inspired by [Byron Smith](http://blog.byronjsmith.com),
for original reference, see [this
thread](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss/Tfe5ac909d5fb476b).
It can also be cloned from [this repo](https://github.com/comp-sci-tools/recipe)



> ## Prerequisites
>
> - A reasonably recent version of Git is installed. For installation
>   instructions and binaries see [the Git home page](https://git-scm.com/).
> - Being comfortable with the command line. No expertise is required, but the
>   lesson will be mostly taken from the command line.
> - Being familiar with using a text editor. Emacs
>   and Vim are excellent choices if you know how to use them but Nano or Notepad
>   on Windows are sufficient.
> - Git should be configured prior to the lesson; see for instance
>   [these instructions](https://comp-sci-tools.github.io/git-intro/helper/git-settings) or 
>   [CodeRefinery git installation instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/).
> - A [GitHub](https://github.com) user account (but alternatives exist, see below).
>
>
> ### Why [GitHub](https://github.com)? 
>
> In this introduction we will mention and use [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
